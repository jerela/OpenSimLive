# OpenSimLive
OpenSimLive is a C++ package that streams orientation data from Xsens MTw Awinda inertial measurement units and calculates inverse kinematics based on that data. It relies on OpenSim for biomechanical analyses and related tools. The current version uses OpenSim 4.1 API and XDA 4.6.

## Getting started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

XDA 4.6 and OpenSim 4.1 are required for core functionality. CMake and Visual Studio are used to configure, generate and build the project. Vicon Datastream SDK 1.10 and Vicon Nexus 2.10+ are required if you wish to perform inverse kinematics on live marker data, but are otherwise optional.
